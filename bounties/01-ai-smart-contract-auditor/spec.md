# Bounty #01: AI Smart Contract Auditor for Conflux eSpace

## Overview

**Reward**: $1,700

**Difficulty**: ðŸŸ¡ Medium

**Timeline**: 3-4 weeks

**Type**: AI/ML Application, Security Analysis, Web Interface

## Problem Statement

Smart contract security auditing is expensive, time-consuming, and often inaccessible to smaller projects on Conflux eSpace. While AI cannot replace human auditors for critical applications, it can provide valuable preliminary security analysis and help developers identify common vulnerabilities before formal audits. There's a need for an accessible AI-powered tool that can analyze verified contracts and provide security insights.

## Solution Overview

Build a web application with backend services that uses Large Language Models to audit verified smart contracts on Conflux eSpace. The system should fetch contract source code via ConfluxScan API, analyze it for common vulnerabilities, and generate comprehensive reports highlighting potential security issues with SWC/CWE classifications.

## Core Features

### 1. Contract Analysis Engine

- Fetch verified contract source code from ConfluxScan API
- Parse and analyze Solidity code for security vulnerabilities
- Integration with multiple LLMs for comprehensive analysis
- Support for multi-file contracts and libraries

### 2. Vulnerability Detection

- Common smart contract vulnerabilities (reentrancy, overflow, etc.)
- Gas optimization opportunities and inefficiencies
- Access control and permission issues
- Logic flaws and edge case analysis

### 3. Audit Report Generation

- Structured JSON and Markdown report formats
- SWC (Smart Contract Weakness Classification) mapping
- CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) references
- Severity scoring and risk assessment

### 4. Web Interface

- Clean frontend for contract address input
- Real-time analysis progress tracking
- Interactive report viewing with code highlighting
- Export functionality for reports

### 5. On-Demand Auditing

- Audit any verified contract by address input
- Batch analysis for multiple contracts
- Historical audit storage and retrieval
- Comparison reports for contract versions

## Technical Requirements

### Architecture

- Frontend: Next.js 15 dashboard with RSC streaming + optimistic UI
- Static Analysis (Required): Slither and Mythril executed via Docker containers and integrated into the analysis pipeline
- AI Framework (Preferred): Mastra agent chain, or an equivalent orchestration approach that combines static tool outputs with LLM analysis
- Vector Retrieval (Preferred/Optional): Pinecone index for "known vuln" patterns and code snippet embeddings, or an equivalent retrieval system; optional if not materially impacting MVP functionality
- Database: Supabase, or PostgreSQL + Prisma as an acceptable alternative for audit reports and contract metadata
- Alternative: FastAPI backend running AutoGen + open-source SWC dataset
- Blockchain Integration: ConfluxScan API and ethers.js

### Core Components

1. Contract Fetcher: ConfluxScan API integration for source code retrieval
2. Code Analyzer: AI-powered vulnerability detection and analysis
3. Report Generator: Structured report creation with multiple formats
4. Web Interface: User-friendly frontend for analysis requests
5. Database Manager: Audit history and result storage
6. API Server: RESTful API for programmatic access

### Analysis Categories
