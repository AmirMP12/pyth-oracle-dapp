# Bounty #01: AI Smart Contract Auditor for Conflux eSpace

## Overview

**Reward**: $1,700

**Difficulty**: ðŸŸ¡ Medium

**Timeline**: 3-4 weeks

**Type**: AI/ML Application, Security Analysis, Web Interface

## Problem Statement

Smart contract security auditing is expensive, time-consuming, and often inaccessible to smaller projects on Conflux eSpace. While AI cannot replace human auditors for critical applications, it can provide valuable preliminary security analysis and help developers identify common vulnerabilities before formal audits. There's a need for an accessible AI-powered tool that can analyze verified contracts and provide security insights.

## Solution Overview

Build a web application with backend services that uses Large Language Models to audit verified smart contracts on Conflux eSpace. The system should fetch contract source code via ConfluxScan API, analyze it for common vulnerabilities, and generate comprehensive reports highlighting potential security issues with SWC/CWE classifications.

## Core Features

- Support for multi-file contracts and libraries

### 2. Vulnerability Detection

- Common smart contract vulnerabilities (reentrancy, overflow, etc.)
- Gas optimization opportunities and inefficiencies
- Access control and permission issues
- Logic flaws and edge case analysis

### 3. Audit Report Generation

- Structured JSON and Markdown report formats
- SWC (Smart Contract Weakness Classification) mapping
- CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) references
- Severity scoring and risk assessment

### 4. Web Interface

- Clean frontend for contract address input
- Real-time analysis progress tracking
- Interactive report viewing with code highlighting
- Export functionality for reports

### 5. On-Demand Auditing
