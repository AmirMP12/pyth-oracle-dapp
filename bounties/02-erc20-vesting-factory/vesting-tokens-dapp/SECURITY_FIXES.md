# Security Fixes & Improvements Summary

This document summarizes all the critical security fixes and improvements made to the vesting tokens dApp.

## 🔒 Critical Fixes Completed

### 1. React Hooks Compliance (HIGH - Frontend)
**Issue**: `useVestingContractBalance` was called conditionally inside loops and functions, violating Rules of Hooks.

**Fix**:
- Moved all hook calls to top-level in `BulkFundingDialog.tsx`
- Created `contractBalances` array with all hooks called at component level
- Updated filtering logic to use array indices instead of calling hooks

**Impact**: Prevents potential runtime errors and improves performance.

**Files Changed**:
- `src/components/vesting/BulkFundingDialog.tsx`

---

### 2. Funding Validation (HIGH - Frontend)
**Issue**: No validation to prevent over-funding vesting contracts.

**Fix**:
- Added `remainingAmount` calculation (totalAmount - currentBalance)
- Capped Max button to `Math.min(userBalance, remainingAmount)`
- Added destructive alerts for exceeding remaining amount
- Auto-fill now only fills the shortfall amount
- Enhanced UI to show current balance and remaining needed

**Impact**: Prevents users from accidentally sending more tokens than needed.

**Files Changed**:
- `src/components/vesting/FundContractDialog.tsx`

---

### 3. Smart Contract Access Control (CRITICAL - Contracts)
**Issue**: Anyone could initialize proxy contracts, potentially taking ownership.

**Fix**:
- Added immutable `factory` address to both contracts
- Constructor sets `factory = msg.sender` (the TokenVestingFactory)
- Added `require(msg.sender == factory, "Only factory can initialize")` check
- Created comprehensive test suite to verify access control

**Impact**: Prevents unauthorized initialization and ownership takeover.

**Files Changed**:
- `contracts/hardhat-project/contracts/TokenVesting.sol`
- `contracts/hardhat-project/contracts/VestedToken.sol`
- `contracts/hardhat-project/test/AccessControl.test.js` (new)
- `contracts/hardhat-project/SECURITY_UPGRADE.md` (new)

**⚠️ Important**: Existing deployments MUST be redeployed with new factory.

---

### 4. Database Transactions (CRITICAL - Backend)
**Issue**: Database operations not wrapped in transactions, risking partial writes.

**Fix**:
- Wrapped all operations in `db.transaction(async (tx) => { ... })`
- All inserts/updates use transaction object (`tx`) instead of `db`
- Added validation for missing schedules and contracts
- Automatic rollback on any error

**Impact**: Ensures data consistency and prevents orphaned records.

**Files Changed**:
- `src/app/api/deployment/save/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/batch-deployment/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/claim/save/route.ts`

---

### 5. API Security (CRITICAL - Backend)
**Issue**: No rate limiting or input sanitization on API routes.

**Fix**:
#### Rate Limiting
- Created in-memory rate limiter (15min/100 requests for POST, 15min/300 for GET)
- Returns 429 status with retry-after header when exceeded
- Includes rate limit info in all response headers
- Automatic cleanup of expired entries

#### Input Sanitization
- Created sanitization utilities for strings, URLs, emails, addresses
- Removes HTML tags and dangerous characters
- Validates Ethereum addresses and transaction hashes
- Sanitizes all optional fields (description, website, logo)

**Impact**: Prevents DoS attacks and XSS vulnerabilities.

**Files Changed**:
- `src/lib/api/rate-limit.ts` (new)
- `src/lib/api/sanitize.ts` (new)
- `src/lib/api/rate-limit.test.ts` (new)
- `src/lib/api/sanitize.test.ts` (new)
- All API routes updated with rate limiting and sanitization

---

### 6. Database Duplicate Handling (MEDIUM - Backend)
**Issue**: Duplicate claim submissions could cause double-counting.

**Fix**:
- Check for existing claim by transaction hash before insert
- Use `onConflictDoNothing({ target: vestingClaims.txHash })`
- Handle race conditions by fetching existing claim if insert returns nothing
- Return helpful response indicating duplicate

**Impact**: Prevents double-counting of claims and ensures idempotency.

**Files Changed**:
- `src/app/api/claim/save/route.ts`

---

### 7. Vesting Contract Clarity (LOW - Contracts)
**Issue**: Vesting calculations lacked validation and clear comments.

**Fix**:
- Added validation: `require(duration > 0, "Duration must be greater than 0")`
- Added validation: `require(cliff <= duration, "Cliff cannot exceed duration")`
- Added validation: `require(vestingDuration > 0, "Vesting duration must be greater than 0")`
- Enhanced comments explaining each phase of vesting
- Prevents division by zero errors

**Impact**: Clearer code, better error messages, prevents edge case bugs.

**Files Changed**:
- `contracts/hardhat-project/contracts/TokenVesting.sol`

---

### 8. Test Coverage (LOW - Testing)
**Issue**: New API utilities had 0% test coverage.

**Fix**:
- Created comprehensive tests for rate limiting (29 tests)
- Created comprehensive tests for sanitization (29 tests)
- All tests passing
- Coverage for API utilities now at 84.5%

**Impact**: Ensures security features work correctly.

**Files Changed**:
- `src/lib/api/rate-limit.test.ts` (new)
- `src/lib/api/sanitize.test.ts` (new)

## 🚀 Deployment Checklist

### Before Deploying

- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Check test coverage: `npm run test:coverage`
- [ ] Build application: `npm run build`
- [ ] Compile contracts: `cd contracts/hardhat-project && npx hardhat compile`
- [ ] Run contract tests: `npx hardhat test`

### Smart Contract Deployment

1. Deploy new factory to testnet (Sepolia):
   ```bash
   cd contracts/hardhat-project
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-factory-sepolia.js --network sepolia
   ```

2. Verify deployment:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/check-deployment.js --network sepolia
   ```

3. Update frontend with new factory address in `.env`:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FACTORY_ADDRESS_SEPOLIA=0x...
   ```

4. Test deployment manually:
   - Deploy a test token
   - Fund vesting contract
   - Attempt claim
   - Verify database records

### Frontend Deployment

1. Update environment variables
2. Build production bundle: `npm run build`
3. Deploy to Vercel/hosting platform
4. Verify all routes work correctly
5. Test rate limiting (should see 429 after 100 requests)

## 📝 API Rate Limits

### POST Routes (Write Operations)
- **Limit**: 100 requests per 15 minutes
- **Routes**: `/api/deployment/save`, `/api/batch-deployment`, `/api/claim/save`

### GET Routes (Read Operations)
- **Limit**: 300 requests per 15 minutes
- **Routes**: All GET endpoints

### Response Headers
```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 100
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 95
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1234567890
```
