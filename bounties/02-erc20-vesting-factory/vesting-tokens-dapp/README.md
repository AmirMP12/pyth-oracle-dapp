## ‚ö° Quick Deploy & Start (Alternative Method)

For developers who want to quickly deploy the contract and start the application in one command, we provide an automated deployment script.

### One-Command Deployment

```bash
# Make the script executable (first time only)
chmod +x deploy-and-start.sh

# Run the automated deployment and startup
./deploy-and-start.sh
```

### What the Script Does

The `deploy-and-start.sh` script automates the entire process:

1. **üöÄ Contract Deployment**: Navigates to `contracts/hardhat-project` and deploys to Sepolia
2. **‚öôÔ∏è Environment Setup**: Automatically extracts the contract address and updates `.env`
3. **‚ñ∂Ô∏è Service Startup**: Starts the application using `make start`
4. **‚úÖ Verification**: Checks if services are running properly

### Prerequisites for Quick Deploy

Before running the script, ensure you have:

- **Hardhat Configuration**: `.env` file in `contracts/hardhat-project/` with:
  ```env
  PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
  SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=your_sepolia_rpc_url
  ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=your_etherscan_key  # Optional
  ```
- **Sufficient Sepolia ETH** for contract deployment
- **Make** installed on your system

### Benefits of Quick Deploy

- **‚è±Ô∏è Time Saving**: Deploy and start in one command
- **üîÑ Automated**: No manual environment variable updates
- **‚úÖ Error Handling**: Built-in validation and error checking
- **üéØ Focus**: Concentrate on development, not deployment setup

### Manual Alternative

If you prefer the traditional approach, follow the [Installation & Setup](#-installation--setup) section below.

## üìã Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js 18.17.0 or higher
- npm or yarn package manager
- Git
- A crypto wallet (MetaMask recommended)
- Alchemy API key
- WalletConnect Project ID

## üîß Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd project_name
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file with the following variables:

```env
# Blockchain Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID="your_wallet_connect_project_id"
NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_API_KEY="your_alchemy_api_key"
NEXT_PUBLIC_MAINNET_FACTORY_ADDRESS="0x1121C77E3AcC2281982AD91c53702A71E56d6Cd2"
NEXT_PUBLIC_SEPOLIA_FACTORY_ADDRESS="XXXX"


# Supabase Configuration
DATABASE_URL="your_supabase_database_url"
```

### 4. Database Setup

Initialize the database schema using Drizzle:

# Generate database migrations
npm run db:generate

# Apply migrations to database
npm run db:migrate

# Optional: Open database studio
npm run db:studio
```

### 5. Start Development Server
