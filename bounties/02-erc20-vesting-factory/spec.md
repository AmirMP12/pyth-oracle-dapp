# Bounty #02: ERC20 + Vesting Contract Factory

## Overview

**Reward**: $1,000

**Difficulty**: ðŸŸ¢ Small

**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks

**Type**: Smart Contracts, DeFi, Factory Pattern

## Problem Statement

Token launches and fundraising projects on Conflux eSpace need a simple way to deploy ERC20 tokens with built-in vesting mechanisms for team allocations, investor distributions, and community rewards. Currently, teams must deploy and configure multiple contracts separately, which is complex, error-prone, and expensive. There's a need for a unified factory solution that handles both token deployment and vesting in a single transaction.

## Solution Overview

Build a Factory smart contract that allows users to deploy a new ERC20 token and configure vesting conditions in a single transaction. The system should support both cliff and linear vesting schedules, handle complex allocation scenarios, and include a user-friendly frontend for collecting deployment parameters and managing vested tokens.

## Core Features

### 1. Factory Contract System

- Single transaction deployment of token + vesting contracts
- Configurable token parameters (name, symbol, supply, allocations)
- Multiple vesting schedule support per token
- Gas-optimized deployment through minimal proxy patterns

### 2. Vesting Logic Implementation

- Cliff vesting (tokens locked until specific date)
- Linear vesting (tokens released gradually over time)
- Combined cliff + linear vesting schedules
- Multiple beneficiary support with different schedules

### 3. Token Management

- Standard ERC20 functionality with OpenZeppelin base
- Initial token distribution and allocation
- Owner controls for token management
- Integration with vesting for locked allocations

### 4. Frontend Interface

- User-friendly deployment interface
- Vesting schedule configuration UI
- Beneficiary management dashboard
- Token claiming interface for vested tokens

### 5. Batch Operations

- Deploy multiple token projects via script
- Batch vesting schedule creation
- CSV import for large beneficiary lists
- Launchpad-style project management

## Technical Requirements

### Architecture

- **Frontend**: **Remix** wizard UI (form actions ideal for deployment flows)
- **Backend**: **NestJS** job worker for batch deploy processing
- **Database**: **Supabase** to store vesting schedules and beneficiary data
- **Smart Contracts**: **ethers.js** deployer with OpenZeppelin libraries
- **Factory Pattern**: Minimal proxy clones for gas efficiency
- **Alternative**: Same with **FastAPI** deployer for Python preference

### Core Components

1. **Factory Contract**: Main deployment and configuration logic
2. **Token Template**: Upgradeable ERC20 implementation
3. **Vesting Contract**: Time-based token release logic
4. **Frontend Application**: UI for deployment and management
5. **Deployment Scripts**: Automated deployment and verification
6. **Management Dashboard**: Token and vesting administration

### Vesting Types

- **Cliff Vesting**: All tokens released at specific date
- **Linear Vesting**: Gradual release over time period
- **Cliff + Linear**: Combination of both mechanisms
- **Custom Schedules**: Flexible configuration options
